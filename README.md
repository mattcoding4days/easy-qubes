# Easy-qubes

> The Hitch Hikers Guide to Qubes OS, by Matt and Kieran.

## :warning: Things you should likely not do

1. **DO NOT** enable tor updates for Whonix, as who ever owns the majority of the nodes on TOR
   owns the network.    
   
2. One issue with Qubes is it only supports one desktop environment officially, which is Xfce.
   There is a KDE implementation but it is not officially supported and therefor we **DO NOT**
   reccomend using it.

## :keyboard: Generic linux commands to help you

> Do not type in the dollar sign, it represents the shell prompt.
> Directory is also called a `Folder`

```bash
# List absolute path to your present working directory
$ pwd

# move back one directory
$ cd ..

# cd into the home directory, the tilde `~` operator represents home in the unix world
$ cd ~

# if you are in your home directory cd into the Downloads directory
$ cd Downloads

# List the contents of your current directory
$ ls

# List the contents of your current directory and show the file permissions
$ ls -l

# List the contents and all hidden files (also known as dot files)
$ ls -a

# make a directory (new folder) called `Jorts`
$ mkdir Jorts

# Remove the folder called `Jorts`
$ rmdir Jorts

# Create a new file called `jorts.txt`
$ touch jorts.txt

# Remove the `jorts.txt`
$ rm jorts.txt
```
